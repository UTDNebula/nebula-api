These organisms known for their simplicity of structure and gene similarity to humans have been seminal in advancing our understanding of many biological processes and human diseases. In this inquiry-based course, learners will apply basic principles of genetic model systems, transmission genetics, and molecular genetics to investigate important biological concepts such as embryonic cell division, stem cells and regeneration, Mendelian inheritance, gene mutations, and phenotypes. Throughout this exploratory course, students will gain practical hands-on experience conducting basic culturing, genetic manipulation and phenotypic analysis necessary to utilize genetic model organisms in their investigation.

These organisms known for their simplicity of structure and gene similarity to humans have been seminal in advancing our understanding of many biological processes and human diseases. In this inquiry-based course, learners will apply basic principles of genetic model systems, transmission genetics, and molecular genetics to investigate important biological concepts such as embryonic cell division, stem cells and regeneration, Mendelian inheritance, gene mutations, and phenotypes. Throughout this exploratory course, students will gain practical hands-on experience conducting basic culturing, genetic manipulation and phenotypic analysis necessary to utilize genetic model organisms in their investigation.

This course will begin with a review of the theoretical foundations of the client-consultant relationship, drawing from counseling psychology and other disciplines, then broaden to cover theories of Organizational Behavior, Organizational Learning and Strategy. Through various workshops and hands-on exercises, participants will apply these theories in a number of scenarios relevant for consulting. Special attention will be given to prepare students to become confident practitioners, by bridging the theory-practice gap in the practice of management and organizational consulting.

It will help identify potential uses and the benefits and considerations for robotic process automation. The students will learn the elements of a business process and the basics of developing a BPM application, implementing triggers to automate processes, defining and measuring KPIs. Students will use elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities to handle high-volume, repeatable tasks that previously required humans to perform. These tasks can include queries, calculations, and maintenance of records and transactions. Students will be able to use apply analytics to the generated data for a systematic computational analysis of data for the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data that will be used",

		"Description": "BUAN 6392 - Causal Analytics and A/B Testing (3 semester credit hours) This course focuses on the distinction between correlation and causation in data. This distinction is critical for managers to understand the effect of proposed managerial interventions. For example, an advertiser may want to know whether referral marketing interventions will be effective for its customers, and, if so, what types of messages may be used to implement a referral marketing program with a high degree of success. Similarly, a music service like Spotify may want to know what kinds of promotions will help increase the number of subscribers in the most effective way. The course will focus on the design and analysis of A/B tests to tease out the difference between correlation and causation. It will also focus on statistical techniques that can be used with observational data to achieve reliable causal inferences in the absence of experimental data. The course employs a combination of lectures, cases",

Thus, all project teams are to follow standard industrial practices and methods. Teams must carry the engineering project to completion, examining real world and multiple design constraints, following applicable industrial and business standards. Such constraints may include but are not limited to: economic, environmental, industrial standards, team time/resource management and cross-disciplinary/departmental result integration. Students are required to work in teams that include collaborative design interaction. Additionally, cross-disciplinary teams are encouraged but not required.

Topics include: Learning the use of common laboratory electronic equipment; understanding the assembly of electronic circuits; and making various measurements. Students also learn how to work together with a partner and how to write a laboratory report. The lecture introduces general engineering practices, engineering research at UT Dallas, engineering activities at selected local companies, and concepts such as innovation and invention. The course also includes lectures and projects on communication, understanding the importance of lifelong learning, ethics, and a knowledge of contemporary issues. CE 1202 may be taken by students outside of engineering in order to learn about the engineering profession. Lab",

This class covers the security of cyber-physical systems from a multi-disciplinary point of view, from computer science security research (network security and software security), to public policy (e.g., the Executive Order 13636), risk-assessment, business drivers, and control-theoretic methods to reduce the cyber-risk to cyber-physical critical infrastructures.

Therefore, primary course aims include a thorough discussion of stochastic dynamics and optimization. Next, using these methods, applications that illustrate the applied general equilibrium analyses that comprise: modern macroeconomic business cycle theory, consumption, asset pricing and topics in 'behavioral' macroeconomics are discussed.

Thus, all project teams are to follow standard industrial practices and methods. Teams must carry the engineering project to completion, examining real world and multiple design constraints, following applicable industrial and business standards. Such constraints may include but are not limited to: economic, environmental, industrial standards, team time/resource management and cross-disciplinary/departmental result integration. Students are required to work in teams that include collaborative design interaction. Additionally, cross-disciplinary teams are encouraged but not required.

Topics include: Learning the use of common laboratory electronic equipment; understanding the assembly of electronic circuits; and making various measurements. Students also learn how to work together with a partner and how to write a laboratory report. The lecture introduces general engineering practices, engineering research at UT Dallas, engineering activities at selected local companies, and concepts such as innovation and invention. The course also includes lectures and projects on communication, understanding the importance of lifelong learning, ethics, and a knowledge of contemporary issues. EE 1202 may be taken by students outside of engineering in order to learn about the engineering profession. Lab",

The main models examined in the course are binary logit and probit, multinomial logit, ordinal probit, tobit, and the family of Poisson regression models. All these models are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The Heckman correction for selection is also addressed. Recommended: EPPS 6316 or the equivalent. (3-0) T",
